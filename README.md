# Official Crea Localizations
This is the official repository for Crea localizations. Here community members can help contribute to official localizations that will be bundled with Crea.

# How to Contribute?
Thanks for being interested in contributing to Crea's official localizations! :+1:

Anyone is welcome to contribute to an entirely new localization or an existing localization. Crea Localizer Tool greatly assists in this process - [read how to use it here](http://playcrea.com/mod/creating-localizations.html#creating-localizations).

First thing you will need to do is [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and get started writing. Once you are ready to submit your localization you can [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

## New Localization Contributions
Starting a new localization is easy if you follow the guide modding guide mentioned above. One thing to keep in mind though is that others may want to help contribute to the same localization. Be sure to communicate your contributions in the `#localizing` channel on the [Crea Discord](http://discord.gg/crea).

## Existing Localization Contributions
When contributing to an existing localization it is best to communicate with other contributors of that localization to avoid duplicating efforts. It is also important to maintain consistency throughout the text so be sure to read through what has already been writen before writing anything yourself.

## Crea Updates
Before Crea receives an update this repository will be updated with the new `en.locale` file. With this you can replace this with the current version at Crea install folder `mods/core/ui/en.locale`. With the updated file you can see which localizations have changed or been added through the Localizer tool.
